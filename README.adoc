== Origin

Groovy Pacman is based on a fairly simple Java implementation of the famous 80's game Pacman. The original sources stem from the
{javagamestutorial}[Java 2D Games Tutorial] on zetcode.com, which contains and explains implementations of a number of classic games, aside from a rudimentary version of {pacman}[Pacman]. Definitely worth a {javagamestutorial}[visit]!

== Plans

The idea is to start-off with Zetcode's Java 2D tutorial version and transform it into a nice playable game that eventually will run on an Arcade Game console such as shown below. The hardware part will be an interresting project on it's own, involving building a cabinet from wood, paint it properly and assemble the electronics probably using a RPi and buttons and stuff from Adafruit or a similar shop.

== Things to do

 - Port it to Groovy 2.5 or 3.0, just for fun
 - Refactor the code a bit since it does not really separates concerns very well
 - Add sound effects, since the original game does not have any sounds
 - Extend the maze since it is a bit small right now
 - Add levels, since there is only one in the original
